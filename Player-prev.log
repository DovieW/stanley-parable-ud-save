Parent of RectTransform is being set with parent property. Consider using the SetParent method instead, with the worldPositionStays argument set to false. This will retain local orientation and scale rather than world orientation and scale, which can prevent common UI scaling issues.

BoxColliders does not support negative scale or size.
The effective box size has been forced positive and is likely to give unexpected collision geometry.
If you absolutely need to use negative scaling you can use the convex MeshCollider. Scene hierarchy path "Area_6_OfficeHallways/Area_6_OfficeHallways_DYNAMIC/Area_6_OfficeHallways_Audio/meetingroomdoor/Door Blocker"

BoxColliders does not support negative scale or size.
The effective box size has been forced positive and is likely to give unexpected collision geometry.
If you absolutely need to use negative scaling you can use the convex MeshCollider. Scene hierarchy path "Area_6_OfficeHallways/Area_6_OfficeHallways_DYNAMIC/Area_6_OfficeHallways_Audio/meetingroomdoor/Door Blocker"

If you absolutely need to use negative scaling you can use the convex MeshCollider. Scene hierarchy path "Area_15_Hallway_BroomCloset/Area_15_Hallway_BroomCloset_DYNAMIC/Area_15_Hallway_BroomCloset_Audio/staircasedoor/Door Blocker"

BoxColliders does not support negative scale or size.
The effective box size has been forced positive and is likely to give unexpected collision geometry.
If you absolutely need to use negative scaling you can use the convex MeshCollider. Scene hierarchy path "Area_6_OfficeHallways/Area_6_OfficeHallways_DYNAMIC/Area_6_OfficeHallways_Audio/meetingroomdoor/Door Blocker"

BoxColliders does not support negative scale or size.
The effective box size has been forced positive and is likely to give unexpected collision geometry.
If you absolutely need to use negative scaling you can use the convex MeshCollider. Scene hierarchy path "Area_6_OfficeHallways/Area_6_OfficeHallways_DYNAMIC/Area_6_OfficeHallways_Audio/meetingroomdoor/Door Blocker"

BoxColliders does not support negative scale or size.
The effective box size has been forced positive and is likely to give unexpected collision geometry.
If you absolutely need to use negative scaling you can use the convex MeshCollider. Scene hierarchy path "Area_6_OfficeHallways/Area_6_OfficeHallways_DYNAMIC/Area_6_OfficeHallways_Audio/meetingroomdoor/Door Blocker"
